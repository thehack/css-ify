# CSS-ify 
### Mostly Useless!

Some webservices allow custom css but do not allow the hosting of images. In such cases, this script might be useful.
To use this little tool: 

1. replace the Van Gogh image with an image of your choosing and give it the name of your choosing.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Create an html document with one, absolutely-positioned div element, and
4. Copy the generated text as a css rule assigned to that div.
